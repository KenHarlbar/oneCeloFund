# One Dollar Fund

This is an app that enables people to donate to the cause/need of other people.

Anyone who wishes to donate through the app can only donate a dollar, hence, oneDollarFund app.

The reason why I have made it so is to enable more people to contribute to other people's need instead of just a few poeple (that is, cultivating the spirit of helping with the little each and everyone of us have).
